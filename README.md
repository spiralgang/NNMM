## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits, and can be used for digit classification.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spiralgang/nnmm.git
cd nnmm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You might also need to install TensorFlow if it's not included in the requirements file.

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

## Usage

To train and evaluate the model, run the `main.py` script.

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:
1. Load the MNIST dataset.
2. Preprocess the data.
3. Define the neural network model.
4. Train the model.
5. Evaluate the model on the test set.

## Model Architecture

The neural network model consists of the following layers:
- Input layer with 784 neurons (one for each pixel in the 28x28 images)
- Hidden layer with 16 neurons and ReLU activation
- Hidden layer with 8 neurons and ReLU activation
- Output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) and softmax activation

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. The training process includes:
- 5 epochs
- Batch size of 32
- 20% of the training data used for validation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set and the accuracy is printed.
